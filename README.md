AVM 1.0 Demos
-------------

See README in each demo file for details

Install the sandbox from here:

https://github.com/algorand/sandbox

run `./sandbox up dev`

!!! Note: These demos rely on a default unencrypted wallet in the kmd so only release/beta/nightly/dev sandbox configs will work

Install `py-algorand-sdk` and `pyteal`

Run any of the demo.py files to see them execute
